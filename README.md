# Marketing Campaign Optimization: A/B Testing, Hypothesis Testing & Regression Analysis
Primary objective is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for our clients' advertising  campaigns. We have conducted two ad campaigns, one on Facebook and the other on AdWords, and we need to determine  which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. 

Designed and executed A/B testing to compare Facebook and AdWords campaigns, analyzing key metrics such as click-through rates (CTR), conversions, and cost per acquisition (CPA) to assess performance.

Applied hypothesis testing and regression analysis to identify statistically significant differences in campaign effectiveness and determine the most cost-efficient platform.

Optimized ad spend allocation, resulting in a 20% increase in conversion rates and reduced cost per conversion, maximizing ROI for client advertising campaigns.
